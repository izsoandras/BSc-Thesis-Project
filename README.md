#### Autonomous robotic platform navigation with embedded computer vision
During this project I designed and implemented a robotic platform and compared a few localization algorithms using it. These algorithms were:
- Magnetometer + Accelerometer
- Magnetometer + Encoder
- VISO2
- ORB-SLAM2

I modified the two computer vision library in order to compile and run it on a Raspberry 3b+. The forks of their repositories can be found here:
